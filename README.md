- Hi, I’m @Eldot
- For 15 years up to 2002, I was a software & firmware developer in the UK in Data Comms and then in Medical automation.
- Then I switched role to IT Management until my retirement. Now, I am rebuilding my developer role but as a Maker.
- My goal is to develop, build and use wearable healthcare software and devices for my own use.
- I am currently learning Flutter and Rust, building on my existing experience in C & C++. 
- I am also learning Embedded Machine Learning with Edge Impulse and others.
- While I'm still learning, I’m not looking to collaborate on any project because I'm not ready yet.
- I tweet as @Eldot, but only very occasionally because I don't have much to say.
